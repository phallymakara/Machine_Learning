Your job is to build a \"Descriptive Statistics\" tool that can take any list of numbers and automatically calculate the key metrics needed for a report.\n",

    "1.  **`mean(data)`**: Returns the average ($\\frac{\\sum x}{n}$).\n",

    "1.  **Process:** Call all five functions from Task 1 and store the results in a Dictionary.\n",
    "2.  **Display:** Print a formatted table. Use string formatting to align the text and values into columns."
